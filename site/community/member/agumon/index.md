# @agumon0241

Hello I'm `@agumon0241`! 

Hey there! My name is Edgar but I go by Agumon. I'm currently studying computer science and I'm really enjoying playing around with machine learning models. I would like to break into data science but I'm also down to learn some fullstack and fiddle around with Figma designs. I'm into watching anime and playing games like Dark Souls, Magic the Gathering, and RimWorld. If you can't find me on discord, I'm either trying out new food recipes or going on a hike. I hope we can get along and motivate each other to continue learning!

This is my space on Guayahack.
