## III - Identity

The identity of GuayaHack and its members is _*not*_ based on superficial characteristics such as appearance, age, creed, sexual orientation, background, social status, political affiliation, computer proficiency and so on. 

On the contrary, the _*only*_ requirement for participation is a total commitment to the empowerment of others, before one's own, through education as well as the mastery and use of technologies of common interest and relevance.
