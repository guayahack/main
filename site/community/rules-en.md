# Reglas (Big Endian[^BIGENDIAN])

[^BIGENDIAN]:https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness

## 0x00 00 00 00


All activity performed within GuayaHack by its members is aimed to comply with {doc}`/community/memorial`.

## 0x01 00 00 00


Respect, cordiality and intellectual integrity among members in their interactions take precedence over _*everything*_.

## 0x02 00 00 00


Willingness to learn and knowledge are the purpose that brings members together. Each member has valuable information from their experience and should share it, to the best of their ability, without restraint in order to contribute to the growth of others.

## 0x03 00 00 00


The activities, challenges and dynamics generated within the community are given *non-profit* and are governed under the open use license *with attribution*.

## 0x04 00 00 00


The participation of all members is voluntary and, while collectively guided, as far as possible autonomous and will be given according to their capabilities and availability.

## 0x05 00 00 00


In order to facilitate effective and efficient learning and mutual understanding, all participants will use the most precise and detailed language possible and the most public and far-reaching manner available; in 1-1 conversations two learn in 1-N conversations:

$$
\begin{align}                                                                                        
\text{Let }  \alpha&:=\text{learning rate}\\                                                   
\text{Let }  n&:=\text{participants}\\
&\therefore\\
\lim_{n \to +\infty} \alpha(n) &= \infty\\
\end{align}
$$ 

## 0x06 00 00 00


In order to perpetuate the viability of the space into the future, members will _*always*_ endeavor to document, record, codify and share their tools, techniques and procedures in whatever form and space are appropriate to do so.

## 0x07 00 00 00


Discussions centered on politics, religion and sex, although topics with social relevance, divide and often generate conflict. GuayaHack is *not* the place for such discussions.

## 0x08 00 00 00


The {doc}`/wiki/organizacion-rol-moderador` will be able to flag, remove and filter content that deviates from the main theme of the community in _*all forms and in all spaces*_. 

## 0x09 00 00 00


These rules do not exist in order to perpetuate its own existence, but in order to ensure that GuayaHack complies with its {doc}`/community/memorial` and will be modified as necessary.

## 0x0A 00 00 00


All activity conducted by, on and with GuayaHack is for the purpose of educating its members and they in turn are under an obligation to use their knowledge solely for *ethical and lawful* purposes.

## 0x0B  00 00 00


Our official means of communication is the Discord server. Through the platform we will manage spaces, discussions, meetings and so on. Also, all relevant events will be published in {doc}`/calendario`, {doc}`/noticias` and [#rules](https://discord.gg/kPUKbKNP). Contacting members outside of Discord without them expressing interest is unacceptable.
